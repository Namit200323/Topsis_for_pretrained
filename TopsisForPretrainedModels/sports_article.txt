Before the first Test, Rohit Sharma spoke how tempted he is to play Kuldeep Yadav. Having chosen to play on traditional Indian pitches that were full of runs and offered slow turn in the series thus far, Kuldeep offered an interesting package. A left-arm tricky wrist-spinner, who is unique in the sense that batsmen don’t face such tribe often. But given India’s batting concerns, they were more inclined to Axar Patel in Hyderabad. And even here, ahead of the Test, there were deliberations if Washington Sundar should be included as a straight-swap for Ravindra Jadeja.

And on a day where India showed promising signs of taking control of the second Test, largely due to Jasprit Bumrah’s work of genius, Kuldeep too showed what they could have missed in his absence. In the second innings at Hyderabad, despite Bumrah conjuring magic with reverse-swing, he had found no support from the other end as Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja had both conceded over 100 runs for the first time in an innings at home. Here India were without Jadeja and Ashwin was far from his best, going wicketless for only his fifth time in a completed innings in India. In the 12 overs he sent down, the off-spinner gave away 61 runs. Axar Patel delivered four overs, removing Zak Crawley, but even then he didn’t entirely look the part on a surface that was far better for batting than it was in the first Test.

It is not as if Kuldeep was tidy with his economy. He too went for 71 runs in his 17 overs, but time and again, he kept creating chances. As England’s openers began strongly after Yashasvi Jaiswal’s maiden double century (209 off 290b, 19×4, 7×6) powered India to 396, it was Kuldeep who removed Ben Duckett. Among India’s spinners, he is the slowest of them all. On a slow track, he gave enough revs, made the ball grip and turn. And Duckett could only edge it to silly-point.
