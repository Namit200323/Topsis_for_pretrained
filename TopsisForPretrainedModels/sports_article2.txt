AB de Villiers on Saturday confirmed that Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma were expecting their second child which has led to the star Indian batter missing the first 2 Tests against England.

“All I know is he is fine. He is spending a bit of time with his family, that is the reason he is missing the first two Test matches. I am not going to confirm anything else. I cannot wait to see him back. He is fine, he is doing well,” AB de Villiers said on YouTube.

The South African batter who shares a great rapport with Kohli off the field due to their shared time in Royal Challengers Bangalore, also shared excerpts from the texts which he and Kohli had exchanged which confirmed that the Indian star was expecting a child.
