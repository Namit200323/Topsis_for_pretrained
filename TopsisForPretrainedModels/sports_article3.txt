Under the mild winter sun, Vinesh Phogat stepped onto the wrestling mat in the cordoned-off practice area adjacent to the main venue of the Senior National Wrestling Championships at the Railway Stadium in Jaipur. After a series of stretching routines and warm-up drills, she began grappling. A few minutes earlier, she was in the VIP area exchanging pleasantries with officials, coaches and posing for selfies and group photographs. Her face lit up on seeing the qualification rounds of the Greco-Roman wrestlers. “This looks like a proper nationals is taking place, doesn’t it? It is a relief to see that wrestlers are back on the mat in an Olympic year,” she said.

Vinesh has butterflies in her stomach but is relieved to return to competition after nearly a year and a half. On Sunday, the 29-year-old world championship medalist will feature in the 55kg category.

An untimely knee injury also made matters worse and scuppered her Asian Games plans
